## Synchronous

Code will run one statement after another.

Typically considered "BLOCKING", as the next line won't run until the current statement is completed.

## Asynchronous

Code that won't necessarily run in the order it was written.

"NON-BLOCKING" in that next lines can run right away after an asynchronous instruction is registered.
