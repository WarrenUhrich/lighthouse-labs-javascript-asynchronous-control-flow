## Synchronous Code

Code runs from top-to-bottom one line at a time! Typically referred to as "blocking" code.

## Asynchronous Code

Code that runs... NOT top-to-bottom! Usually more-so "non-blocking" code.

## High Order Function

Function that can receive a function as a parameter, and/or return a function!
