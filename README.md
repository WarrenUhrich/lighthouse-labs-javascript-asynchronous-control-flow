## Synchronous

Code will run one statement after another.

Typically considered "BLOCKING", as the next line won't run until the current statement is completed.

## Asynchronous

Code that won't necessarily run in the order it was written.

"NON-BLOCKING" in that next lines can run right away after an asynchronous instruction is registered.

## High Order Functions

A function that does one of, or both of:

1. Accepts a function as a parameter.
2. Returns a function as a response.
