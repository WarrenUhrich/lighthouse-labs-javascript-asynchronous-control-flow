## Synchronous Code

What is synchronous code?
* Code that runs in the order it is written
* Commands are executed one after another in sequence
* "Blocking Code"

## Asynchronous Code

What is asynchronous code?
* Code that runs outside of the expected or "regular program flow"
* Useful for cases where we aren't sure how long a step might take
    * Requesting info from APIs / websites
    * Requesting info from a database
    * Reading a file
    * Writing a file
    * Running code after a set amount time
