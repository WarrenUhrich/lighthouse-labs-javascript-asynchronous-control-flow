* [ ] Node and the Filesystem (`fs`)

## Synchronous Code

* This type of code executes statement-by-statement (line-by-line)
* This is the type of code/programming that we've focused on so far
* Each statement must follow to completion before the next one begins
* This type of code/statement is BLOCKING

## Asynchronous Code

* This code doesn't necessarily run in the order it is written
* We might be able to queue multiple statements at once
* These sorts of statements or functions might be delayed, take time, or be scheduled
* Often used in time-intensive operations
* NON-BLOCKING, we can run our main program while a time-intensive operation continues or is kept track of in the background
